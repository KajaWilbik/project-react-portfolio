# React Portfolio
Week 9 of Technigo Bootcamp. The project was to re-write porfolio by using React and fetching data from Github API as well using styled component in the React. 

## The problem
Biggest problem was to learn how to fetch data from Github. I approched problem by reading more about fetch and how API works, as well as asking about help in the moment when I thought I will give up and build my own JSON. Another problem was to styled the fetched components using styled, I did not manage to fix the issue before hand-in.
